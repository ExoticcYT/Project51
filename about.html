            <h3><br>
                    Exoticc Studios is a company that is all about entertainment and fun.
                The studios were found by Anish Pandey, AKA Exoticc (that is why we call it 'Exoticc' Studios), and all he or I do is just make you entertained. 
                We do all kinds of things here in the company. We make games, we make videos, we teach, we make websites, we play video games, and so much more.
                I used to be part of this clan called ReCharge, but I am on my own now. Support me by subbing to my channel, joining the Exoticc Squad, join my Discord, and follow me on insta. Let's have some fun!

                    Exoticc Studios began by me getting educated about coding by Byju's Future School. Right now, the members of Exoticc Studios would be my elder cousin brother and myself.
                I was born in 2007 and am turning 14 this year in 2021. I am a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan, and a huge Fortnite fan, to learn more about me, all you have to do is be friends with me.
